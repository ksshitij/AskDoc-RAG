# AskDoc RAG üí¨

**Chat with any PDF!** This is a web application built with Streamlit that lets you upload a PDF document and ask it questions. It uses the Google Gemini AI, LangChain, and a Chroma vector database to find contextually-aware answers from *within your document*.

This project is a powerful demonstration of a complete **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline.
